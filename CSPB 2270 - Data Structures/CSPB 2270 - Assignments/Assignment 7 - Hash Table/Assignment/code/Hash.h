// Advice for approaching this assignment:
//
// Many of the unit tests depend on more than one function. For
// example, the [hash func] test requires init_table to work. Because
// of this I recommend you proceed in this order:
//
// 1. init node
// 2. init table
// 3. hash func
// 4. bucket func
// 5. set
//
// Once you're there, you can take on the rest: load, get, contains,
// remove, and (if you're feeling saucy) resize.
//
// resize has less credit compared to other ones, you can ignore it if you are happy with a grade above 90.

// hash_node represents the contents of an individual bucket in your
// hash table.
struct hash_node {
  // deleted indicates if the node was marked as removed from the hash
  // table. it should be initialized to false.
  bool deleted;

  // key is the key the user provides to associate with a value.
  std::string key;

  // hashcode is the hashcode computed by the hash table's hash_func
  // on the key. it is stored to avoid having to re-compute it.
  unsigned int hashcode;

  // value is the user value associated with the key.
  std::string value;
};

// you can define your custom types like this one
// this is a vector where each index has a pointer to a hash_node object
// htable is used in hash_table struct bellow, you can define a table dynamically for ex:
//
//     //dynamically create a has_table object first
//     shared_ptr<hash_table> myhashtable(new hash_table);
//     // then create the htable for the size you like (say mysize)
//     myhashtable->table = shared_ptr<htable>(new htable(mysize));
//
// you can also use resize() property of vector to resize your table later
//
//     myhashtable->table.resize(new_size);
