   |    We clearly can't use unit testing to ensure that you're         |
   |    actually implementing the correct algorithm. I suppose we could |
   |    write some complicated static analysis checker. But it is       |
   |    easier to just look at it with our eyeballs.                    |
   |                                                                    |
   |    After the assignment is due, we will look at the most recent    |
   |    version of your implementation that got the highest score and   |
   |    make sure you're not doing something sneaky like using a        |
   |    standard library call to sort a vector.                         |
   |                                                                    |
   |    Anyone caught doing this (even though it is kinda funny) will   |
   |    be given 0 points on the assignment.                            |
   |                                                                    |
