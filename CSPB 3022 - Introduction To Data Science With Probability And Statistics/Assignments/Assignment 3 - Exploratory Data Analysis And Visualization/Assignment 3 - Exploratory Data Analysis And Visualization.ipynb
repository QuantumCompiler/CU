    "The Money Ball era that was studied of the Oakland Athletics is a very popular one in baseball. Originally, in 1998, the Oakland Athletics were in the bottom five of payroll and did not win very many games. Upon adopting this new data science strategy, called Money Ball, the general manager Billy Beane hired an analyst away from another team to help get the most 'bang for their buck' with players. This strategy ended up paying dividends for the organization as they maintained the same relative salary cap as they did previously, but won a lot more games.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a stark contrast between the wins total of the Oakland Athletics in 1998 and 2003. Upon adopting this new strategy, the Oakland Athletics managed to win a lot more games with close to the same salary cap. This same trend can be observed in 2013, as the A's salary cap hasn't grown very much, but they are still winning a significant number of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy was widely adopted by other small market teams, including the Tampa Bay Rays, and it worked for them as well. We can see that the use of data science in this context has a profound affect on a teams performance and can provide a tremendous uptick in production at the major league level."
