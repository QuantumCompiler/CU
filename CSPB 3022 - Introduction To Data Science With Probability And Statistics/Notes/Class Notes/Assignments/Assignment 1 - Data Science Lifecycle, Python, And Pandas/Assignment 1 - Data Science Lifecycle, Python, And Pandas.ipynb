    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",

    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by an Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
