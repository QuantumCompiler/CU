My strategy for learning anything is to first 'baseline' the idea / theorem and apply it to a simple example. Take for example integration in calculus. It would be a mistake to try to learn how to integrate by parts before one learns how to integrate a polynomial. So, starting with the polynomial integration, one should solve an integral that is straight forward. I do this for just about any math concept that I am trying to learn.\n",
