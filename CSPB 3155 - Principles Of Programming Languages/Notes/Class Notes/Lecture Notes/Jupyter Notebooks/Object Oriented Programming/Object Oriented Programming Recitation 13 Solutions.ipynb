    "1. `\"m1 in B\"` - D doesn't implement m1 directly, so the method defined by B is used, which overrides m1 on A.\n",
    "2. `\"m2 in A\"` - Method m2 on class D is overloaded, and this call is to the overload that also overrides m2 from B and implements m2 from C.\n",
    "3. `\"m2 in D\"` - Method m2 on class D is overloaded, and this call is to the overload that is not inherited from either B or C\n",
    "4. `\"m3 in C\"` - The implementation of m3 is inherited from C\n",
    "5. `\"m4 in D\"` - m4 is defined only by D, and so doesn't override anything.\n",
    "6. `\"m1 in B\"` - Though it has been cast to an A, the underlying object is still a D, and so we go through it's inheritance hierarchy and find that m1 is overriden in B.\n",
    "7. `\"m2 in A\"` - Since nothing overrides m2, we use the only implementation in our hierarchy, found in A.\n",
    "8. `\"m1 in A\"` - A does not inherit from anything, thus there is only one possible method to call.\n",
    "9. `\"m2 in A\"` - A does not inherit from anything, thus there is only one possible method to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. valid - D inherits from B which inherits from A, so (since inheritance is transitive) D \"is an\" A.\n",

    "3. valid - The object is a D, it's just being treated as an A by the type system, so this is safe because D \"is a\" C (in other words, D <: C)\n",
    "4. invalid - a is not a D, so it doesn't have the methods class D claims to provide."

Using an adapter pattern allows the programmer to clean up the interface and allow code from two different interface styles to interact.
