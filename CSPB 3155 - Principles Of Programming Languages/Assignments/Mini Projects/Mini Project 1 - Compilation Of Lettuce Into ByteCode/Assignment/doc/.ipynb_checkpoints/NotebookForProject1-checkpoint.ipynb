    "  \n",
    "- `StoreI(identifier)`: Take the value that `identifier` maps to in the environment (if `identifier` is not present, then throw an exception). Let the value be `v`. Push `v` onto the top of the stack.\n",
    "  - Example: `StoreI(\"zaza\")` will look up the environment for the value `zaza`, say `4.3`. It will push `4.3` onto the top of stack. Environment is unchanged by this operation. \n",

    "- `MultI`: pop two numbers from the stack, multiply them and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is empty during any of the pop operations.\n",
    "- `DivI`: pop two numbers from the stack, let the first number popped be `v1` and second number be `v2`, subtract them as `v2 / v1` (this order is very important)  and push the result back to the stack. Throw an exception if the stack is emptyduring any of the pop operations. Throw exception if division by zero.\n",
