    "# Event Driven Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a _framework_ that allows us to design interactive applications \n",
    "such as animations and games using our own event driven programmning system.  We will also program a classic arcade game in this system according to the specification. Once again, we will describe the framework here and what you need to do. Your goal is to implement the missing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall system has three parts: \n",
    "- MainEventLoop : this maintains a list of _entities_ and list of _events_.\n",
    "- Entities are objects that implement the `handleEvent` method in order to handle an event e. As a result, the entity gets transformed into a new list of entities, and generates a new list of events. \n",
    "- Events are broadcast to all entities. Each event implements an `appliesTo` method that defines all entities that it can be broadcast to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entities \n",
    "Entities are described in the file `Entity.scala`. The main contents are reproduced below.\n",
    "- An entity has a unique integer `id`.\n",
    "- An entity __must__ implement a function called `handleEvent` that implements how an event `e` transforms an entity. As a result, the entity can be transformed into a list of zero, one or multiple entities. Also, new events can be generated in this process.\n",
    "- An entity may optionally implement a render function with a `Graphics2D` handle, or if it does not the entity is not drawn on the canvas."
