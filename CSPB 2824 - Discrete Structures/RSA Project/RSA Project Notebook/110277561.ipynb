    "RSA is a data encryption / decryption technique that is widely used in multiple facets in society for the safe transfer of data and information. RSA incorporates many mathematical procedures ranging from fast modular exponentiation (FME) to the extended Euclidean algorithm (EEA) and more. This project aims to generate encrypted messages that can be decrypted with the use of public key exchanges between parties. With access to these keys, one can decrypt encrypted messages in a safe manner where only the intended parties have access to the information. I will walk through the necessary components that were used to build this project, demonstrate its use, and discuss the results from this project. Furthermore, I will discuss possible pitfalls that exist in this project and how they can be improved."

    "During the process of completing this project I had to formulate a game plan as to how to complete each part of the project. I first started making the necessary components of the project by completing the problems in the mastery workbooks. I originally made an FME algorithm that was recursive (of which I did not initially know was acceptable) and then learned that it was not allowed. So, I had to go back to the drawing board and rewrite my algorithm so that it matched the one from Rosen. I am more inclined to use recursive algorithms when possible because of the difficulty for outsiders who may plan to copy my code at some point. Plus I really think recursion is cool and thus why I prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the FME algorithm I moved on to completing the EEA algorithm. Both of these algorithms are imperative to RSA's success and so I spent a lot of time making sure that they did what they needed to do. Upon completing each algorithm, I first checked simple problems by hand to make sure that they were working in the way that they were intended to work. This enabled me to make sure that my algorithms were correct. I then scoured the internet to find resources that would allow me to check more complicated examples. For the FME algorithm I used a resource at (https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/power-modulo) to work on more complicated examples. Once the results that I input online were matching with that of my algorithm I had full confidence that my algorithm was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then moved on to checking that my EEA algorithm was working the way that I had hoped. At first I worked with simple examples and checked again that what I was putting into my EEA was correct by checking it by hand. Once I got the simple examples were working (I primarily checked my examples with my work from the mastery workbook problems) and then moved on to finding resources online that could handle more complicated computations. For the EEA I used a resource at (https://planetcalc.com/8586/) to check more complicated examples with my custom EEA. After completing this process I moved on to working on the functions inside the Jupyter notebook so that they could all be pieced together. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the FME and EEA algorithms were completed I moved on to the algorithms that were inside the mastery workbook. Before I put my finished code for each algorithm I made a separate Python file that contained the necessary components from previous algorithms so that they could be tested with the new one that I was currently working on. The first three algorithms, Convert_Text, Convert_Num, and Convert_Binary_String were rather easy for me to complete. At first I was trying to code Convert_Text manually instead of using ord() and this was a big mistake for me. I was trying to construct arrays, dictionaries, and other containers that could be used to store ascii codes with certain containers and that was a nightmare for me. I then went back to the comments in the notebook and researched what ord did in the context in Python and I was able to complete the first algorithm after that. Completing Convert_Num was rather simple with the use of chr and then the last basic algorithm that I needed to complete was Convert_Binary_String and this leads to my funniest mistake that I made in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am good at a lot of things but one thing that I am subpar in is reading directions. This proved to be a big achilles heal to me as I spent a copious amount of time hand coding a decimal to binary algorithm. I cannot understate how long I spent on this one algorithm alone. I had no idea how to get it to work, I had no idea what to store the result in at first, and I had no idea how to even begin. So I referenced Rosen and was able to get on track with the pseudo code that was provided to me. Upon completing the algorithm originally I noticed that my digits were in reverse order. Thankfully I had spent a lot of time in Python in my past when I was a physicist and was able to quickly reverse the string that I was working with inside the algorithm. After completing the algorithm and then putting it inside my notebook I noticed that we were allowed to use bin in this function and I let out an audible groan after all the time that I had spent coding my algorithm. After this algorithm I made sure to read the instructions before starting my algorithms and the rest of the product went pretty smoothly from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then proceed to complete the remaining algorithms with a lot less effort and was able to get my code working where I could accurately produce keys, encode a message, and decode a message that was given to me. At this point I was now ready to start exchanging keys and codes with classmates. Upon getting all of the algorithms complete the first message that I attempted to decrypt was the one that Professor Stade posted that was supposed to say \"Hello Earth\". Upon putting all of the necessary information into my IDE I was jumping with joy to see that my code was actually working. This then enabled me to go to other threads and check that my code was working with other people's posts. In the first thread that involved students posting both their public and private keys with their cipher text, I was able to decode the messages with relative ease and it wasn't too hard for me to produce a response. After I had confidence that I was able to decode people's posts with ease I moved on to producing my own post. I wanted to be a little bit different and test the limitations of RSA so I found a resource at (https://bigprimes.org/) that allowed me to produce very large primes. I believe that some people may have been a little apprehensive in decoding my message because of the size of keys but people who did not respond to the post on Piazza said that they were able to decode my post and that gave me confidence that my algorithms were working.\n",
    "\n",
    "After posting and responding to messages in Piazza in the public thread I moved on to breaking codes in its respective thread. This was more challenging for me because I was unable to decrypt some peoples posts but upon with consulting with other students I found out that they were having the same problem. I had to baseline my code breaking with an example that I knew was most likely correct. So, I broke the code that was posted by Professor Stade and I was able to successfully break it so I knew what I was doing was most likely correct. I did have a mistake in my Find_Private_Key_d function in how I was handling the generation of d when the original was negative. Originally I was just returning the other Bezout coefficient but upon consulting with Professor Stade I realized that was incorrect and I had to go back to the drawing board. I then changed my code so that it added the modulo value to d until it was positive and returned that key after. Upon fixing my code I was able to break other students code and had an efficient and correct process for breaking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this project and was very happy with the results that were produced upon completing it. This is by far one of my favorite projects that I have worked on and I am very happy that I got an opportunity to do so."

On the other hand FME can calculate these results much faster and more securely.\n",

    "I personally believe that deserve a 15/15 for my custom feature. I am not new to programming so making something like a main function was trivial to me. So instead I wanted to push myself and learn something new. This is why I chose to make a GUI for this project (with the exception of code breaking). I have worked with frameworks in the past that involved HTML and JS but since this program was done in Python I wanted to do something new to myself.\n",

    "Thankfully, the book that I used was a great reference for making GUIs with Python. I had to spend a lot of time tinkering with small aspects here and there to make sure that my program did what it was designed to. I pushed my self to find a way to incorporate generating random prime numbers in a given range and with pre-existing code. Before this project, I really hadn't done anything similar to this as I was very apprehensive about making GUIs because they looked very intimidating to me. But through perseverance I was able to make it all work. I am very proud with what I made and this project seemed trivial to me at the beginning but I can't put into words how much my opinion has changed. RSA has proven to be a very interesting topic and this will definitely be something that I will be putting on my portfolio at some point. Of course with more error handling however.\n",

    "Thank you to Professor Stade for making the exception for me so that I could bring this to life. This was truly a great learning tool for me and I can't put into words how thankful I am that I was able to do this. I learned a lot of new things that have opened up the door for me in the future when building projects and I will always look back to this project as the starting point for me. Thank you again."
