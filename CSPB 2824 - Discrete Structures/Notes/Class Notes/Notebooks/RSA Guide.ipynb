At this point it is not about points, but exploring advanced ideas relevant to you. This is also a feature that should be relevant to your programming ability. If you are in 1300, creating a main type function may be enough. If you are an experienced programmer, find a topic to push yourself. \n",

    "1. Code breaking improvements. An exploration of factoring improvements and analyze how effective they are. Must include some kind of timing analysis and multiple code breaking. A superficial treatment will not recieve full points. Must be throughly tested with excellent investigations to recieve full points.\n",
    "2. A Python \"main\" function that allows a user to \"Get keys/Encode/Decode/Break Codes\" etc... This can use elements of initial RSA code above HOWEVER please include all your code here. It should be well-organized. *Include your complete new implementation in section 10.*\n",
    "3. A script to read codes from Piazza data. You can copy and paste codes from Piazza into a txt files and then have your script read it. This is a VERY helpful tool for doing the project as well. \n",
    "4. Exploration of advanced factoring alogrithms (see Moodle) Try Pollard's Rho <- super satisfying. (full points if well - impemented with thoughtful examples). \n",
    "5. Advanced complexity analysis. \n",
    "6. Frequency anaylsis from our Piazza post.\n",
    "7. A deep dive in the mathematics of the RSA proofs.\n",
    "8. Advanced code breaking challenges  - this should be an organized and well-documented effort.\n",
    "9. More options available, all include a coding element. Please ask is you have an unique idea. "

I have posted a tutorial on it here: [Pollard's Rho](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/courses/csci2824-spr14/pollardsRho.html). My code is in the C language, but you will have to implement it in Python. You should focus on the main ideas. There are other much better online expositions. Can you understand and implement it?\n",

    "* Warning: This is really advanced stuff for beginner programmers, but perhaps never too early to learn some ideas on parallelization (which you will revisit in other classes).
