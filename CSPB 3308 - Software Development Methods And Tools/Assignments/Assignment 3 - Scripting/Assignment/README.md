### Lab 3 - More Scripting and Team Meeting to perform an Agile Sizing Activity
There are two parts to this lab and each one has deliverables. 

#### 1. Individually creating more Scripting
Individually, you will continue to create scripts for processing the data.  You will complete two more scripts that will take parameters and produce the correct directory structure and another to extract the data for a given game.  

You will continue to write scripts to perform more complex tasks.

Script to create the correct subdirectories in the storage hierarchy and download a specific HTML file from the Jarchive website.

Script to create the set of extracted data files for a given `year` and `game id`.  Locate the correct directory for the source data and extract data files into that same directory.

Details of the script requirements can be found in [Lab 3 :  Part 1 - More Scripting](LAB_3_SCRIPTING.md)

#### 2. Team Meeting for Sizing of User Stories
You will work as a team for the other part of the lab.
This will be the first time for many of you to work on a project that has multiple developers.  One of the fundamental reasons that teams give for their success is constant communications including a weekly meeting with all team members.

You will schedule a team meeting to complete this lab.  You need to find a time where all the members can meet so they can participate.  

During your meeting you will perform an Agile activity to review the set of **user stories** and gauge the effort that would be involved to meet the request's functionality.   This is NOT the design or scheduling of the tasks, but a quick estimate of the effort needed.  Remember to follow the Agile meeting format for this part of the lab. 

The effort level is a relative assignment and does not correspond to hours, days, or weeks.  A task that takes effort of 8 would take approximately three times as long as task with an effort assigned a value of 3. It may help you to size the efforts by having each individual sort the stories by level of effort they think it will take to complete.  Then you can have a better relative effort estimation during the meeting.

All team members must agree on the level of effort required for a specific **user story** through simultaneous voting on an effort level.  Each story may require multiple rounds of discussion and individual estimation before reaching a consensus.

The effort level required by many of the tasks associated with the **user story** will not be known because no one on the team has any experience with the task.  This is common in industry when taking on new features.  Use your best guess about how much effort will be required to learn a new subject or get familiar with the complexity of new tools.

Once you have completed the sizing discussions and effort level resolution for each of the **user stories**, you can proceed to creating a list of criteria that will indicate that you have completed the development task for a specific **user story**.
