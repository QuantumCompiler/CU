There are two parts to this assignment: team and individual.  The team will arrange a meeting time, perform sizing of feature requests,  and design acceptance criteria for those feature requests.   
    
* Team Activity   
     * arrange team meeting time(s)
     * perform sizing of feature requests
     * design acceptance criteria for requests

## Team Activity
### Step 1 : Creating a Meeting Time
Schedule a zoom meeting where all members of your team will be present.

If you cannot arrange a meeting, private post in Piazza (PM) your instructor and we can try to work out other arrangements.

When you have set the day/time for your meeting, PM the instructor with your team number and the planned date/time for the meeting.
Record the meeting using Zoom! Ask the instructor for help if there are problems getting zoom to work for you.

### Step 2 : Elect a Scrum master
Elect a scrum master for your team. 
You need to elect someone to manage the meetings.  During the semester you may want to change the scrum master between team members.  However, for any given week or sprint, the scrum master should remain the same.

__What best describes a scrum master?__
    
In simple terms, the Scrum Master can be defined as the servant-leader of the Scrum Team. The individual is responsible for ensuring that the team adheres to the theory, practices, and rules of set forth in your management framework.  Other names for the scrum master include servant leader, coach, or facilitator. Despite using the term “master,” the person in this role does not have the authority to make strategic or substantive decisions about the project.  They are there to make sure your meetings stay focused and productive. 

 There are other roles that need to be filled in an Agile team.  It is possible to share or trade roles throughout the project.

### Elected Scrum Master must request the set of **User Stories** for your team to use in the assignment
Have your elected scrum master must send a private Piazza message
the instructor to obtain a document with the list stories will need to address in the next step.
The meassage should indicate which team you are on and that you have been elected "Scrum Master".
This needs to be done at least 48 hours before your sizing meeting is scheduled to allow time to receive the needed data.

<hr>

### Step 3 : For each user story : estimate the size of the effort needed
Once you have received the stories to be used, the Scrum Master will make those available to the team (suggest that you place them in the team repository). You will need to create document to capture summary of effort levels in a unitless estimation for each of the **user stories**.
In this step of the lab, you will be practicing the Agile process of sizing each of the **User Stories**.

<img src="images/deliverable.png" alt="Deliverable Item" WIDTH=40 ALIGN="left" />

You will record your planning session and make the video and audio available.  Make sure all team members participate and please have your video active during conversations.

#### Practice Planning Poker
Your estimations of effort are in unitless amounts.  The levels represent a relative difficulty, not an absolute unit.   Planning Poker uses "cards" with labels: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, ?.  So a story with effort level 8 should be about four times harder to implement than a story with effort level 2. The card with "?" means "I have no idea", try to use it sparingly.

**For each story:**
   1. The Scrum master reads aloud a single single user story.
   2. The team members (including scrum master) each privately "pick a card" (maybe write your number on a piece of paper).
   1. All team members reveal their choice simultaneously.
   1. If the numbers are all the same
   
       * record your estimation 
       * move to the next user story.<br><br>
   1. If the numbers are NOT all the same, 

       * discuss the effort required
	   * start by having the highest and lowest voters explain their reasoning
       * discuss the story together as a team
       * GOTO step 2
**Note:** It should take several rounds of voting and discussion for each user story to come to a consensus.   

Avoid just "averaging" the scores, let each person make their best judgment and communicate their thinking.  One of the outcomes of this lab is to make sure the team lets each individual express their comments and ideas and that other team members listen to those comments and ideas.

Complete the planning poker activity for each of the given user stories.  The Scrum Master is responsible for recording all the consensus effort levels.  These will be added to a document that includes the story, the effort level, and the criteria that must be met for the tasks of the user story to be satisfied.
<hr>

### Step 4 : For each user story: Create Acceptance Criteria
Add acceptance criteria to each user story in a summary document of this planning step.

Each **User Story** provides an informal, natural language description of a feature of the software or product from an end-user perspective.  You have been provided with a set of **User Stories** for your team.  Each user story has specific information.  The user role, the description of desired behavior,  and the outcome or reason the feature is being requested are provided for you.
As a team, you will evaluate each story and provide a set of criteria that could be used to validate the tasks of the story.

```
User Story Card
______________________________________________________________________________
As a 	: <user role>
I want	: <description of desired behavior>
So that : <reason for desired behavior / what you get from it>

Effort
Level	: <level of effort : dimensionless units>

Acceptance Criteria
Given	: 	<context of action>
When 	: 	<some action is completed>
Then 	: 	<set of observable outcomes>
____________________________________________________________________________

```

Your team will create a document with the user stories, the effort level determined by the group, and the set of acceptance criteria.  The document should be a markdown document and the cards can be copied from the information given to the scrum master. You can use the markdown template document supplied to the scrum master and update the required information.

Once the team has completed the creation of the document, each team member will add the document to their local assignment repository. 

Format for the SIZING.md document for the Team Activity:

   * Team Number
   * Team Name
   * Day/Time of Weekly Team Meeting
   * Planning Poker Results
     * Team Members in meeting (indicate the elected scrum master for the meeting)
     * Link to Zoom recording of team activity
     * Description of each User Story using the following format:
       * story (as a ... I want ... so that ...)
       * agreed upon effort level 
       * a set of acceptance criteria.
    
See the appendix below to see some examples of good and bad acceptance criteria. 

<hr>

### Step 5 : Determine a weekly day/time to meet to discuss the project

Find a permanent day and time for your weekly meeting.  You should schedule up to an hour of time, but often you can complete the full team meeting in a half hour.  Let the team members take lengthy discussions that only concern some of the team,  offline or moved to another scheduled meeting.  You will need a recording of a meeting for your Milestone 2.
Below is a brief description of the weekly meeting agenda.
    
Use the weekly meeting to quickly let each team member say: 

 * What was accomplished in the previous week?
 * What is planned for the next week?
 * What impediments stand in your way of accomplishing them?
    
Once each team member has given their status, you will need to **reflect** as a team about the last sprint (week) and what worked, did not work, and how the process might change to provide better performance.

Step 5 is completed when you send a private Piazza message to the instructor with 
your team # and the scheduled time for your meetings.

### You have completed the Lab-3 Team Activity.  
    
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that all your added files and changes are **pushed** to the remote repository before going to Moodle to submit your completion information in the Moodle assignment.
See the [README for the Lab](README.md) for the information each team member must submit.

Here is what you should have accomplished:
	
	1. Had a team meeting to size the effort of **user stories* and have made a recording of that meeting
	2. Created a document listing the story and the effort estimation
	3. Added acceptance criteria for all the user stories
	4. You have established a weekly meeting time

### Appendix of good and bad User Story Acceptance Criteria    
    
User stories are written in the following format: 
```
As a (type of user), I want to (perform some action) so that I (can achieve some goal/result/value).
```

The purpose of user stories is to explain the roles of users in a system, their desired activities, and what they intend to accomplish by successfully completing a user story. For Agile teams, user stories are the primary method of identifying user needs.

How can we make sure that user stories are completed correctly and comply with a user story? We define acceptance criteria to formalized list of requirements that ensure that the user stories are completed and all scenarios are taken into account. 

Acceptance criteria specify conditions under which a user story is fulfilled. Concisely written criteria help development teams avoid ambiguity about a client’s demands and prevent miscommunication.

#### Example 1 -  good criteria
**As a:**  website user
**I want to:** be able to search on the webpage
**So that I:** can find necessary information

According to the Given/When/Then template, the acceptance criteria would be the following:

##### Scenario: User searches for an item by its name
**Given:** that I’m in a role of registered or guest user   
**When:** I open the “Products” page   
**Then:** the system shows me the list of all products <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND the system shows the “Search” section in the right top corner of the screen
    
**When:** I fill in the “Search” field with the name of existing item in the product list <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND I click the “Apply” button OR press the Enter key on keyboard   
**Then:** the system shows products in the Search Results section with product names matching entered product name <br>AND the system shows the number of search results in the top of the Search Results section
   
#### Example 2 - good criteria
**As a:** signed-in user
**I want to:** be able to comment on a blog post
**So that I:** can get feedback on issues
    
Scenario: Signed-in user leaves a comment on a blog post   
**Given:** I’m in a role of signed-in user   
**When:** I open the page with a specific blog post   
**Then:** the system shows the “Comments” section below the blog post with the list of comments added by other users
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND the system shows the “Add a Comment” field in the top of the “Comments” section   
**When:** I fill in the “Add a Comment” field with my comment
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND I click the “Submit” button   
**Then:** the system saves my comment
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND the system shows my comment in the top of the “Comments” section
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND the system shows my username and profile picture on the left side from my comment
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AND the system shows “Remove” and “Edit” icons opposite my comment
    
### Here a a partial list of what a criteria should not include:
* shouldn’t specify the solution 
* shouldn’t include the look and feel. They can specify objects that must be presented, just not how they look (color, size, wording, ...))
* must Don’t include enough information to be truly “suitable for development” testing
* has open questions or gaps
* has no measurable items in the criteria
* has vague criteria such as 'produces the correct output'
* goes beyond the intended scope of the user story

#### Example 3 - BAD criteria - specify the solution
**As a** learner, **I want** to receive a cheerful confirmation after completing a lesson, **so that I** stay motivated to continue learning.
 
Acceptance Criteria:   
**When:** a user completes a lesson,   
**Then:** the URL query string lessonComplete is set to true.  On the learning path, if and only if URL query string lessonComplete is true, the completion card is displayed.


#### Example 4 - BAD criteria - not measurable
**As a** learner, **I want** to receive a cheerful confirmation after completing a lesson, **so that I** stay motivated to continue learning.
 
Acceptance Criteria:   
**When:** a user completes a lesson,    
**Then:** the learner is encouraged.

#### Example 5 - BAD criteria - vague criteria
**As a** product manager, **I want** to keep the project's status current each week, **So that** all team members and stakeholders can see the progress being made

Acceptance Criteria:   
**When:** a developer completes a task,    
**Then:** the project management tool is updated.
