When you create a website, you have a set of files, images, and HTML code that make up your website. To be available for public access, these files need a place to live that is available 24/7. Without a public online host, your files would just sit on your computer and no one would ever see them. A hosting provider will provide a place on a web server to store all of your files and are responsible for delivering the files of your website as soon as a browser makes a request by typing in your domain name.

Web hosting is a service that provides organizations and individuals 
with a platform to store their website files and make them accessible online. 

Hosting allows you to rent space on a server in their server space.
There you can store your website data, such as HTML and CSS files, media content, and other documents.
You can also rent services to run your web site so that your website can be accessed by anyone with an Internet connection 24/7.
Web hosting is typically provided by web host providers, which are businesses that maintain, configure, and run physical servers to house websites.

### This assignment will focus on introducing  you to Web Site Hosting and automated Deployment

### Getting Started

You will be using tutorials from Flask and Render to complete this lab.
Follow the step by step [Render_tutorial](Render_tutorial.md) that we have provided to walk you through the forking (create your own version of a respository) of a Flask app, creating website in Render, Allocating a Database in Render, and Connecting your repository to the website for automated deployment.  We also walk you through connecting to the database, creating some tables and data, and then displaying the information in the web pages.
