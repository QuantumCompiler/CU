                    The Rubik's Cube, invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974, is a 3D puzzle with six colored faces. Solving it involves aligning all colors on each face. 
                    Despite its 43 quintillion configurations, it can be solved in 20 moves or fewer. It symbolizes intellectual challenge and is popular in education and competitions.

                    Along with the standard 3x3 Rubik's cube, there are other sizes for the Rubik's cube. I personally own a Rubik's cube of the size 10x10. Here are some other interesting Rubik's cube inspired puzzles!

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Megaminx</b> - A 10 sided inspired puzzle that is <i>extremely</i> difficult to solve in comparison to the standard 3x3 Rubiks cube.</li>
                    <li><b>Pyraminx</b> - A four sided inspired puzzle that is often regarded as the <i>easiest</i> of this style of puzzles to solve.</li>
                    <li><b>The 1x1</b> - Believe it or not, there is actually a 1x1 Rubik's cube. Interestingly enough, this is a puzzle that is often regarded to be difficult to solve.</li>
