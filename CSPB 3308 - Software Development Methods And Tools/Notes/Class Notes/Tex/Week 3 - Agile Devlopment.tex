\subsection{Chapter Summary}

The first chapter that is being covered this week is \textbf{Chapter 29: Flow Control - Looping With while \& until} from \textbf{The Linux Command Line}.

\begin{notes}{Chapter 29: Flow Control - Looping With while \& until}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This chapter explores looping constructs in shell scripting, focusing on the "while" and "until" commands. These constructs allow portions of programs to repeat until a specified condition is met, 
    enhancing script usability and control flow.
    
    \subsubsection*{Looping}
    
    Looping is a fundamental programming concept where a sequence of instructions is executed repeatedly. This section introduces the concept using a real-world analogy and then applies it to shell scripting.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Looping]
    
        Looping repeats a sequence of steps until a condition is met.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Real-world example: Slicing a carrot involves repeating steps until the entire carrot is sliced.
            \item Pseudocode example:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    1. get cutting board
    2. get knife
    3. place carrot on cutting board
    4. lift knife
    5. advance carrot
    6. slice carrot
    7. if entire carrot sliced, then quit; else go to step 4
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{while Loop}
    
    The "while" loop repeats commands as long as a specified condition returns a zero exit status.
    
    \begin{highlight}[while Loop]
    
        The "while" loop executes commands repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Syntax: \texttt{while commands; do commands; done}
            \item Example script:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # while-count: display a series of numbers
    count=1
    while [[ "$count" -le 5 ]]; do
        echo "$count"
        count=$((count + 1))
    done
    echo "Finished."
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Improving the Menu Program}
    
    The "while" loop can be used to enhance the menu-driven program by allowing repeated selections until the user chooses to exit.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Improving the Menu Program]
    
        Use a "while" loop to repeat menu display and selection.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example script:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # while-menu: a menu driven system information program
    DELAY=3
    while [[ "$REPLY" != 0 ]]; do
        clear
        cat <<- _EOF_
        Please Select:
        1. Display System Information
        2. Display Disk Space
        3. Display Home Space Utilization
        0. Quit
        _EOF_
        read -p "Enter selection [0-3] > "
        if [[ "$REPLY" =~ ^[0-3]$ ]]; then
            if [[ $REPLY == 1 ]]; then
                echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
                uptime
                sleep "$DELAY"
            elif [[ "$REPLY" == 2 ]]; then
                df -h
                sleep "$DELAY"
            elif [[ "$REPLY" == 3 ]]; then
                if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
                    echo "Home Space Utilization (All Users)"
                    du -sh /home/*
                else
                    echo "Home Space Utilization ($USER)"
                    du -sh "$HOME"
                fi
                sleep "$DELAY"
            fi
        else
            echo "Invalid entry."
            sleep "$DELAY"
        fi
    done
    echo "Program terminated."
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Breaking Out of a Loop}
    
    The "break" command terminates a loop, while the "continue" command skips to the next iteration.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Breaking Out of a Loop]
    
        Use "break" to exit a loop and "continue" to skip to the next iteration.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example script:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # while-menu2: a menu driven system information program
    DELAY=3
    while true; do
        clear
        cat <<- _EOF_
        Please Select:
        1. Display System Information
        2. Display Disk Space
        3. Display Home Space Utilization
        0. Quit
        _EOF_
        read -p "Enter selection [0-3] > "
        if [[ "$REPLY" =~ ^[0-3]$ ]]; then
            if [[ "$REPLY" == 1 ]]; then
                echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
                uptime
                sleep "$DELAY"
                continue
            elif [[ "$REPLY" == 2 ]]; then
                df -h
                sleep "$DELAY"
                continue
            elif [[ "$REPLY" == 3 ]]; then
                if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
                    echo "Home Space Utilization (All Users)"
                    du -sh /home/*
                else
                    echo "Home Space Utilization ($USER)"
                    du -sh "$HOME"
                fi
                sleep "$DELAY"
                continue
            elif [[ "$REPLY" == 0 ]]; then
                break
            fi
        else
            echo "Invalid entry."
            sleep "$DELAY"
        fi
    done
    echo "Program terminated."
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{until Loop}
    
    The "until" loop is similar to the "while" loop but continues until a condition returns a zero exit status.
    
    \begin{highlight}[until Loop]
    
        The "until" loop executes commands until a condition is true.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Syntax: \texttt{until commands; do commands; done}
            \item Example script:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # until-count: display a series of numbers
    count=1
    until [[ "$count" -gt 5 ]]; do
        echo "$count"
        count=$((count + 1))
    done
    echo "Finished."
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Reading Files with Loops}
    
    The "while" and "until" loops can process standard input, allowing file processing within loops.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Reading Files with Loops]
    
        Process files using "while" and "until" loops.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example script with file redirection:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # while-read: read lines from a file
    while read distro version release; do
        printf "Distro: %s\tVersion: %s\tReleased: %s\n" \
        "$distro" \
        "$version" \
        "$release"
    done < distros.txt
    \end{code}
            \item Example script with piped input:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # while-read2: read lines from a file
    sort -k 1,1 -k 2n distros.txt | while read distro version release; do
        printf "Distro: %s\tVersion: %s\tReleased: %s\n" \
        "$distro" \
        "$version" \
        "$release"
    done
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \begin{highlight}[Summary of Key Concepts]
    
        Key concepts for looping in shell scripts:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Looping}: Repeat a sequence of steps until a condition is met.
            \item \textbf{while Loop}: Execute commands repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
            \item \textbf{Improving the Menu Program}: Use "while" loops to repeat menu selections.
            \item \textbf{Breaking Out of a Loop}: Use "break" to exit a loop and "continue" to skip to the next iteration.
            \item \textbf{until Loop}: Execute commands until a condition is true.
            \item \textbf{Reading Files with Loops}: Process files using "while" and "until" loops.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Understanding these looping constructs allows for more dynamic and adaptable scripts.
    
    \end{highlight}
\end{notes}

The last chapter that is being covered from \textbf{The Linux Command Line} this week is \textbf{Chapter 31: Flow Control - Branching With case}.

\begin{notes}{Chapter 31: Flow Control - Branching With case}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This chapter continues the discussion of flow control by introducing the \texttt{case} command in bash. The \texttt{case} command simplifies the handling of multiple-choice decisions, replacing 
    a series of \texttt{if} statements with a more readable structure.
    
    \subsubsection*{case Command}
    
    The \texttt{case} command evaluates a word and matches it against a list of patterns, executing the corresponding commands when a match is found.
    
    \begin{highlight}[case Command]
    
        The \texttt{case} command matches a word against patterns and executes commands based on the match.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Syntax:
        \begin{code}[Bash]
        case word in
            [pattern [| pattern]...) commands ;;
        esac
        \end{code}
            \item Example replacing multiple \texttt{if} statements with \texttt{case}:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # case-menu: a menu driven system information program
    clear
    echo "
    Please Select:
    1. Display System Information
    2. Display Disk Space
    3. Display Home Space Utilization
    0. Quit
    "
    read -p "Enter selection [0-3] > "
    case "$REPLY" in
        0) echo "Program terminated."
            exit ;;
        1) echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
            uptime ;;
        2) df -h ;;
        3) if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
                echo "Home Space Utilization (All Users)"
                du -sh /home/*
            else
                echo "Home Space Utilization ($USER)"
                du -sh "$HOME"
            fi ;;
        *) echo "Invalid entry" >&2
            exit 1 ;;
    esac
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Patterns}
    
    Patterns in the \texttt{case} command use the same syntax as pathname expansion and are terminated with a \texttt{)} character.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Patterns]
    
        Patterns in \texttt{case} match specific values or ranges of values.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Examples of patterns:
            \item \texttt{a)} matches if the word equals "a".
            \item \texttt{[[:alpha:]])} matches if the word is a single alphabetic character.
            \item \texttt{???} matches if the word is exactly three characters long.
            \item \texttt{*.txt)} matches if the word ends with ".txt".
            \item \texttt{*)} matches any value (used as a default case).
            \item Example demonstrating pattern matching:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    read -p "enter word > "
    case "$REPLY" in
        [[:alpha:]]) echo "is a single alphabetic character." ;;
        [ABC][0-9]) echo "is A, B, or C followed by a digit." ;;
        ???) echo "is three characters long." ;;
        *.txt) echo "is a word ending in '.txt'" ;;
        *) echo "is something else." ;;
    esac
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}

    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Combining Patterns}
    
    Multiple patterns can be combined using the vertical bar character \texttt{|}, creating an "or" conditional pattern.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Combining Patterns]
    
        Combine patterns with \texttt{|} to match multiple conditions.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example using combined patterns:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # case-menu: a menu driven system information program
    clear
    echo "
    Please Select:
    A. Display System Information
    B. Display Disk Space
    C. Display Home Space Utilization
    Q. Quit
    "
    read -p "Enter selection [A, B, C or Q] > "
    case "$REPLY" in
        q|Q) echo "Program terminated."
            exit ;;
        a|A) echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
            uptime ;;
        b|B) df -h ;;
        c|C) if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
                echo "Home Space Utilization (All Users)"
                du -sh /home/*
            else
                echo "Home Space Utilization ($USER)"
                du -sh "$HOME"
            fi ;;
        *) echo "Invalid entry" >&2
            exit 1 ;;
    esac
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Performing Multiple Actions}
    
    Modern versions of bash support the \texttt{;;&} notation, allowing multiple actions to be performed for a single match.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Performing Multiple Actions]
    
        Use \texttt{;;&} to continue matching after a successful match.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example script performing multiple actions:
    \begin{code}[Bash]
    #!/bin/bash
    # case4-2: test a character
    read -n 1 -p "Type a character > "
    echo
    case "$REPLY" in
        [[:upper:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is upper case." ;;&
        [[:lower:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is lower case." ;;&
        [[:alpha:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is alphabetic." ;;&
        [[:digit:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is a digit." ;;&
        [[:graph:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is a visible character." ;;&
        [[:punct:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is a punctuation symbol." ;;&
        [[:space:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is a whitespace character." ;;&
        [[:xdigit:]]) echo "'$REPLY' is a hexadecimal digit." ;;&
    esac
    \end{code}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \begin{highlight}[Summary of Key Concepts]
    
        Key concepts for using the \texttt{case} command in shell scripts:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{case Command}: Match a word against patterns and execute corresponding commands.
            \item \textbf{Patterns}: Use pathname expansion syntax to define match patterns.
            \item \textbf{Combining Patterns}: Combine patterns with \texttt{|} for multiple conditions.
            \item \textbf{Performing Multiple Actions}: Use \texttt{;;&} to perform multiple actions for a match.
        \end{itemize}
        
        The \texttt{case} command enhances script readability and simplifies handling multiple-choice decisions.
    
    \end{highlight}

The next set of chapters that is being covered this week is from \textbf{Agile For Dummies} and the first chapter that is covered is \textbf{Chapter 1: Getting The ABCs Of Agile}.

\begin{notes}{Chapter 1: Getting The ABCs Of Agile}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This chapter provides an introduction to Agile, explaining its evolution, the Agile Manifesto, and its core principles. Agile is an incremental and iterative approach to software development that 
    emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering high-quality software through frequent iterations.
    
    \subsubsection*{Looking Back at Software Development Approaches}
    
    To understand Agile, it's important to review previous software development methodologies, including Code-and-Fix, Waterfall, and the Spiral model.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Looking Back at Software Development Approaches]
    
        Software development has evolved through various methodologies, each with its benefits and drawbacks.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Code-and-Fix/Big Bang}: Early approach where software was written and fixed in a single, large release. This method was risky and often resulted in significant errors.
            \item \textbf{Waterfall}: Introduced in the mid-1950s, this model follows a sequential, stage-based approach with phases such as Requirements, Design, Development, Integration, Testing, 
            and Deployment. Despite improvements, it faces issues like schedule risk, limited flexibility, and reduced customer involvement.
            \item \textbf{Spiral Model}: Emerged in the mid-1980s, combining iterative and incremental approaches to manage risk through prototyping and regular feedback.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Introducing the Agile Manifesto}
    
    The Agile Manifesto was created in 2001 by a group of developers to promote lightweight development methodologies. It emphasizes flexibility, efficiency, and teamwork.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Introducing the Agile Manifesto]

The next chapter that is being covered from \textbf{Agile For Dummies} is \textbf{Chapter 3: Getting Started With Agile}.

\begin{notes}{Chapter 3: Getting Started With Agile}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This chapter provides guidance on how to get started with Agile, including planning practices, managing and tracking progress, and reflecting for future improvement. Agile breaks down stakeholders' 
    needs into small chunks, ranked and worked on in priority order over short iterations, reviewed for approval, and delivered to production.
    
    \subsubsection*{Agile Planning}
    
    Agile teams typically divide their release schedule into a series of fixed-length development iterations, usually two to four weeks. Planning involves scheduling work to be done during an iteration 
    or release and assigning tasks to team members.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Agile Planning]
    
        Agile planning occurs at three levels: release planning, iteration planning, and daily planning.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Release planning}: The product owner creates a release plan at the start of each release, containing a release schedule for a specific set of features.
            \item \textbf{Iteration planning}: At the beginning of each iteration (or sprint in Scrum), the team identifies the work to be done, a process known as self-organization.
            \item \textbf{Daily planning}: Development teams hold daily standup meetings to plan the day, usually lasting 5 to 15 minutes.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Attending the Daily Coordination Meeting}
    
    Agile teams start each workday with a brief daily coordination meeting to note completed items, identify impediments, and plan the day's tasks.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Attending the Daily Coordination Meeting]
    
        The daily coordination meeting, or daily standup, is crucial for tracking progress and addressing issues.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each team member states:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Yesterday, I completed [state items completed].
                \item Today, I'm going to take on [state task].
                \item My impediments are [state impediments, if any].
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Creating User Stories}
    
    User stories capture brief descriptions of product requirements, focusing on what the requirement must accomplish for whom.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Creating User Stories]
    
        User stories are used to define what the software will do and what services it will provide to its users.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A user story should include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Title: A name for the user story.
                \item As a <user or persona>, I want to <take this action>, so that <I get this benefit>.
                \item Validation steps: When I <take this action>, this happens <description of action>.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Additional elements may include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item ID: A unique identifier for the user story.
                \item Value and effort estimate: Value indicates the benefit to the organization, and effort represents the complexity of the task.
                \item Author: The person who created the user story.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Estimating Your Work}
    
    Agile teams estimate their work in points, which represent the size and complexity of tasks rather than time.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Estimating Your Work]
    
        Points are used to estimate the size and complexity of work items, helping teams manage their workload.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Points are assigned in whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and represent relative sizes and complexity of tasks.
            \item Teams should avoid equating points to hours to maintain consistency.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Tracking Velocity}
    
    Velocity is the total number of story points completed in an iteration, used to measure a team's work output.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Tracking Velocity]
    
        Velocity helps teams understand their productivity and forecast project timelines.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Velocity is calculated as the total number of completed story points divided by the number of iterations.
            \item Example: If a team completes 15, 19, 21, and 25 points in four iterations, their average velocity is 20 points per iteration.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Measuring Progress with Burndown Reports}
    
    Burndown reports track the number of points completed over time, helping monitor progress and remaining work.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Measuring Progress with Burndown Reports]
    
        Burndown reports show the progress of completing tasks and clearing the backlog.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The X-axis represents iterations, while the Y-axis represents the total number of points.
            \item Burndown reports help visualize the team's progress and velocity.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Test-Driven Development}
    
    Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests before writing the code they validate, leading to higher-quality software.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Test-Driven Development]
    
        TDD ensures that code is written to pass predefined tests, enhancing code quality and efficiency.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Write a small test before writing the corresponding code.
            \item Run the test to ensure it fails, then write the code to make the test pass.
            \item Use automated unit tests to quickly identify and address issues.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Continuous Integration and Deployment}
    
    Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) involve regularly integrating and testing code, ensuring high-quality software.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Continuous Integration and Deployment]
    
        CI and CD help maintain high-quality software by frequently integrating and deploying changes.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CI involves regularly integrating and testing changes, ideally multiple times a day.
            \item CD extends CI by automatically deploying successful builds to various environments.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Presenting Results at the Iteration Review}
    
    The iteration review, or sprint review, is a meeting to demonstrate completed user stories and gather feedback from stakeholders.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Presenting Results at the Iteration Review]
    
        The iteration review showcases the team's accomplishments and gathers stakeholder feedback.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The review is informal but organized, focusing on demonstrating completed work.
            \item Stakeholders provide feedback, and new user stories may be created based on this feedback.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Collecting Feedback in the Iteration Review Meeting}
    
    Feedback from the iteration review is used to improve the product and inform future iterations.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Collecting Feedback in the Iteration Review Meeting]
    
        Collect feedback during the iteration review to refine and prioritize future work.
