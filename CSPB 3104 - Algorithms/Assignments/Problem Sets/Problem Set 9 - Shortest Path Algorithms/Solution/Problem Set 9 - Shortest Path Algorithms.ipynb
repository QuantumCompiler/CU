    "wherein you can take x USD, obtain 5x RMB, and in turn trade them for 2x Euros and finally end up with 1.02x USD back. Every time you exercise this opportunity, you get a 2 cent profit (assuming you can trade for free and there is no spread in the buying and selling prices, but that is another can of worms).\n",

    "To determine the arbitrage currencies in this market, we first construct a directed graph where each vertex is a currency and the directed edges from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ have the weight of $-\\log{(R_{i,j})}$.

We have $n$ currencies in this context, and we could theoretically have an exchange with every other currency in this graph. Thus, we are essentially constructing a matrix-esque type of graph that is of size $n \\times n$ and thus the creation of this graph will be in\n",

To achieve this, we use the **Bellman-Ford** algorithm since it is capable of calculating the shortest distance in a graph where negative edge weights are present. After each iteration of the algorithm, starting at a different vertex each time, if there is at least one resulting shortest path that is less than 1, we know that an arbitrage exists. Namely,\n",
