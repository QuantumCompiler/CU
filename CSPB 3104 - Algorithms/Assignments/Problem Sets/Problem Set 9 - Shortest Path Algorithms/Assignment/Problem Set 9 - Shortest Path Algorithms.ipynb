    "## Question 1: Arbitrage Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrage in finance is a way to make money for sure without much risk. For instance, suppose 1 USD yields 5 Chinese RMB and 1 RMB trades for 0.4 Euros, and 1 Euro trades for 0.52 USD,  you have an arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "wherein you can take x USD, obtain 5x RMB, and in turn trade them for 2x Euros and finally end up with 1.02x USD back. Every time you exercise this opportunity, you get a 2 cent profit (assuming you can trade for free and there is no spread in the buying and selling prices, but that is another can of worms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, arbitrage cannot exist in efficient markets but they can persist for a short amount of time. Electronic traders can then search for such opportunities in real time and rapidly exploit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a basket of $n$ currencies and for each pair of currencies $(C_i,C_j)$, you are given a ratio\n",
    "$R_{i,j}$ that says that one unit of currency $C_i$ is currently fetching $R_{i,j}$ units of $C_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(A)__ Given the ratios $R_{i,j}$ write an efficient algorithm that can detect if any arbitrage opportunities currently exist. What is the running time of your algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "(__Hint:__ Make a graph out of the problem data. What does the presence of arbitrage mean for this graph? )\n",
    "\n",
    "__(B)__ We are not just interested in finding an arbitrage opportunity, but also interested in finding the shortest length opportunity, defined as one that involves the smallest number of trades. Naturally, given that prices change\n",
    "and also given that there are trading fees, such opportunities are more desirable. \n",
