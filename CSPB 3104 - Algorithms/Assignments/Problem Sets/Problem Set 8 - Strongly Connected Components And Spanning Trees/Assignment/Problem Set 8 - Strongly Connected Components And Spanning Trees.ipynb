    "Jane Programmer (of the dreaded dynamic programming assignment) has been reviewing her school's course catalog.  Classes in her department are organized into 8 divisions -- PBNJ-1000 through PBNJ-8999, with each division more difficult than the last.  But Jane has noticed some issues -- some upper division classes have lower division prerequisites, but the opposite is true as well.  In fact, her current course, PBNJ-3104, requires PBNJ-2400 and PBNJ-2400 requires PBNJ-1300, but PBNJ-1300 requires PBNJ-3104! \n",
