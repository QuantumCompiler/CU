    "To design an algorithm of this type, the easiest part is to first acknowledge that the first element of the pre order array is going to be the last element in the post order traversal conversion. What one could do to make this conversion possible is to take the pre order array and first determine what part of the array is the left subtree and what is the right subtree. This can be done by excluding the first element of the pre order array as it is the root of the tree. The left subtree is going to be all elements that are less than the root, and the right subtree is going to be all elements that are greater than the root of the subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have correctly identified the left and right subtrees from the pre order array, we need to construct the post order traversal of each recursively. The first element in each subtree is going to be the root of each subtree. Post order traversal is in the manner that we visit the left node, right node, and root node of each tree (or subtree). In the context of the pre order array that was given to us, we can determine the left node of each subtree as the element that is less than the root, and the right node that is greater than the root. We then apply this recursively until the base condition is met (sub array is empty). Finally, these values are appended to the return array representing the post order traversal, where the last element in the array is the original root of the tree."
