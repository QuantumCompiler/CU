    "A really important algorithm that is used in our everyday lives are encryption algorithms. Encryption algorithms are very important because they perform operations on data in such a way that the data can be safely transferred between users. Without encryption algorithms, one's data could be at severe risk of being intercepted and interpreted.\n",

    "One of the most common encryption algorithms is the RSA algorithm. The RSA algorithm was originally invented by Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) and utilizes something called a public and private key. The public key in the algorithm is calculated with the use of two large prime numbers and some other mathematical operations such as FME (Fast Modular Exponentiation). RSA is extremely safe because breaking the encryption key is very difficult due to the factorization of large numbers. With the difficulty of factoring these large numbers, the runtime that would be required to break the encryption can be on the order of magnitude of how old the Earth is and longer!\n",

Safely transmitting data is a very important aspect of society and something we do everyday, without it, important information would be susceptible to being intercepted and used in ways that the users of the information would not have originally intended."
