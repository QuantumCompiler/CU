\subsection{Chapter Summary}

The chapter that is being covered this week is \textbf{Chapter 3: Linear Regression}. The first section that is being covered from this chapter this week is
\textbf{Section 3.1: Simple Linear Regression}.

\begin{notes}{Section 3.1: Simple Linear Regression}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This section introduces simple linear regression, a fundamental supervised learning method for predicting a quantitative response using a single predictor variable. Linear regression assumes a 
    linear relationship between the predictor and the response, making it a widely used statistical learning method. Though more advanced methods exist, linear regression remains essential, as many 
    complex models are extensions of it.
    
    \subsubsection*{Core Concepts of Simple Linear Regression}
    
    Simple linear regression predicts a response $Y$ based on a predictor $X$, assuming a linear relationship of the form:
    \[
    Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
    \]
    where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\beta_1$ is the slope, representing the modelâ€™s coefficients. These coefficients are estimated using training data to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS).
    
    \begin{highlight}[Core Concepts of Simple Linear Regression]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Predictor and Response}: The predictor variable $X$ is used to estimate the response variable $Y$.
            \item \textbf{Model Coefficients}: $\beta_0$ (intercept) and $\beta_1$ (slope) represent the regression line, determining how changes in $X$ affect $Y$.
            \item \textbf{Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)}: The difference between observed and predicted values, minimized to find the best-fit line.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Coefficient Estimation}
    
    The coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are estimated using the least squares method, which minimizes the RSS:
    \[
    RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
    \]
    where $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of $Y$ based on the $i$-th value of $X$. The formulas for the estimates are:
    \[
    \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}, \quad \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}
    \]
    where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the sample means of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
    
    \subsubsection*{Assessing Model Accuracy}
    
    The accuracy of the regression model can be evaluated using:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Residual Standard Error (RSE)}: Measures the average deviation of the predicted values from the true values.
        \item \textbf{R-squared ($R^2$)}: Represents the proportion of the variance in $Y$ explained by $X$. An $R^2$ value close to 1 indicates a strong linear relationship.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{highlight}[Assessing Model Accuracy]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{RSE}: Provides an absolute measure of the model's error.
            \item \textbf{R-squared}: A measure between 0 and 1 indicating how well the model explains the variation in the response.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Hypothesis Testing}
    
    In simple linear regression, hypothesis tests determine if there is a significant relationship between $X$ and $Y$. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) posits no relationship, while the alternative 
    hypothesis ($H_a$) suggests a relationship exists. This is tested using the $t$-statistic:
    \[
    t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 0}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}
    \]
    where $SE(\hat{\beta}_1)$ is the standard error of the slope estimate. A small $p$-value indicates a significant relationship.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)}: Assumes no relationship between $X$ and $Y$.
            \item \textbf{Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)}: Suggests a relationship between $X$ and $Y$.
            \item \textbf{$t$-statistic and $p$-value}: Used to determine if the slope is significantly different from zero.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
\end{notes}

The next section that is being covered from this chapter this week is \textbf{Section 3.2: Multiple Linear Regression}.

\begin{notes}{Section 3.2: Multiple Linear Regression}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This section introduces multiple linear regression, an extension of simple linear regression that allows for multiple predictor variables. Instead of fitting separate models for each predictor, 
    multiple linear regression incorporates all predictors in a single model, enabling more accurate predictions when variables are correlated.
    
    \subsubsection*{Core Concepts of Multiple Linear Regression}
    
    The multiple linear regression model predicts the response $Y$ using $p$ predictors, each with its own slope coefficient:
    \[
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon
    \]
    where $\beta_j$ represents the association between the $j$-th predictor and the response, holding all other predictors fixed.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Core Concepts of Multiple Linear Regression]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Model Coefficients}: The $\beta_j$'s represent the change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in $X_j$, with other predictors held constant.
            \item \textbf{Least Squares}: The coefficients are estimated by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS), just like in simple linear regression.
            \item \textbf{Prediction}: Given the estimated coefficients, predictions for $Y$ can be made using:
            \[
            \hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \dots + \hat{\beta}_p x_p
            \]
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Assessing the Model}
    
    Multiple linear regression models are evaluated using:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{R-squared ($R^2$)}: Measures the proportion of variance in $Y$ explained by the predictors. It increases as more predictors are added, even if the predictors have weak associations.
        \item \textbf{Residual Standard Error (RSE)}: Estimates the average distance between observed and predicted values.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{highlight}[Assessing the Model]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{R-squared}: A higher $R^2$ indicates better model fit, but adding variables always increases $R^2$, even when they do not improve predictions.
            \item \textbf{RSE}: Provides an absolute measure of model error. Lower RSE means better fit.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Hypothesis Testing}
    
    To evaluate the overall relationship between the response and the predictors, the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero is tested using the $F$-statistic:
    \[
    F = \frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n - p - 1)}
    \]
    If the $F$-statistic is significantly greater than 1, it indicates that at least one predictor is associated with the response.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)}: All predictors are unrelated to the response ($\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_p = 0$).
            \item \textbf{Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)}: At least one predictor is related to the response.
            \item \textbf{$F$-statistic}: Used to test the overall significance of the model. A large $F$-statistic suggests rejecting $H_0$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Variable Selection}
    
    In multiple linear regression, not all predictors may be useful. Methods like forward selection, backward selection, and mixed selection are used to select the most important variables.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Variable Selection Methods]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Forward Selection}: Starts with no predictors and adds variables one by one based on their contribution to model fit.
            \item \textbf{Backward Selection}: Starts with all predictors and removes the least significant one at each step.
            \item \textbf{Mixed Selection}: A combination of forward and backward selection.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Model Fit and Interaction Effects}
    
    While $R^2$ and RSE provide measures of fit, graphical analysis can reveal non-linear patterns in the data. For instance, interactions between predictors (e.g., TV and radio advertising) may 
    enhance predictions, which can be captured by including interaction terms in the model.
    
    \subsubsection*{Prediction}
    
    Once the model is fit, predictions for the response can be made. There are two types of intervals used to quantify uncertainty:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Confidence Interval}: Estimates the uncertainty around the average prediction.
        \item \textbf{Prediction Interval}: Estimates the uncertainty for an individual observation, which is always wider due to additional variability from irreducible error.
    \end{itemize}
\end{notes}

The last section that is being covered from this chapter this week is \textbf{Section 3.3: Other Considerations In The Regression Model}.

\begin{notes}{Section 3.3: Other Considerations In The Regression Model}
    \subsection*{Overview}

    This section explores additional considerations in the linear regression model, particularly focusing on qualitative predictors, interaction terms, and non-linear relationships. It also addresses 
    common problems like collinearity, non-constant variance of error terms, and outliers that may affect the regression model.
    
    \subsubsection*{Qualitative Predictors}
    
    Linear regression can handle qualitative predictors by introducing dummy variables, which represent the qualitative levels numerically.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Handling Qualitative Predictors]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Binary Qualitative Predictors}: For predictors with two levels (e.g., house ownership), a dummy variable can be created:
            \[
            x_i = 
            \begin{cases}
                1 & \text{if the individual owns a house} \\
                0 & \text{if not}
            \end{cases}
            \]
            \item \textbf{Qualitative Predictors with Multiple Levels}: For predictors with more than two levels (e.g., region), multiple dummy variables are created. The baseline category (e.g., East) 
            has no dummy, and other levels are compared to it.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Interaction Terms and Non-linear Effects}
    
    Linear regression models can be extended to include interaction terms, allowing for non-additive effects between predictors. Interaction terms can be written as the product of two variables:
    \[
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \epsilon
    \]
    This models the effect of \(X_1\) on \(Y\) as depending on the value of \(X_2\).
    
    \begin{highlight}[Interaction Terms]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Interaction Between Quantitative Variables}: Interaction terms, such as $\text{TV} \times \text{radio}$, allow the effect of one variable to vary depending on the level of another.
            \item \textbf{Interaction Between Qualitative and Quantitative Variables}: For example, income and student status can interact, indicating different effects of income based on whether someone is a student.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Non-linear Relationships}
    
    Linear models can be extended to capture non-linear relationships by transforming predictors, e.g., using polynomial terms:
    \[
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \epsilon
    \]
    This is still a linear model, but it accounts for curvature in the relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\).
    
    \subsubsection*{Potential Problems in Regression Models}
    
    Several common issues can arise when fitting regression models, including:
    
    \begin{highlight}[Key Regression Problems]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Non-linearity of Predictors}: Residual plots can help detect when linearity assumptions are violated, and transformations like $\log X$ or $X^2$ may be needed.
            \item \textbf{Correlation of Error Terms}: In time series data, residuals may be correlated, leading to underestimated standard errors.
            \item \textbf{Non-constant Variance (Heteroscedasticity)}: When error variances increase with the fitted values, a transformation (e.g., $\log Y$) can stabilize variance.
            \item \textbf{Outliers}: Observations with large residuals can distort the model, and studentized residuals help identify these points.
            \item \textbf{High Leverage Points}: Data points with extreme predictor values can disproportionately influence the model.
            \item \textbf{Collinearity}: When predictor variables are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to estimate their individual effects. This can inflate standard errors and reduce the modelâ€™s accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
    
    \subsubsection*{Collinearity and Multicollinearity}
    
    Collinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated. This makes it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the response variable.
    
    \begin{highlight}[Addressing Collinearity]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Detecting Collinearity}: High correlations in the predictor matrix or a large variance inflation factor (VIF) indicate collinearity.
            \item \textbf{Solutions}: Drop one of the collinear variables or combine them into a single predictor.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{highlight}
