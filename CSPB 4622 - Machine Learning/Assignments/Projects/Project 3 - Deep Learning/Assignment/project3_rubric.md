1. Project topic: (5 pts)
  - Is there a clear explanation of what this project is about? Does it state clearly which type of problem?
  - Does it state the motivation or the goal (or why itâ€™s important) clearly?


2. Data: (5 pts)
  - Is the data source properly quoted and described? (including links and brief explanations)
  - Do they explain the data description properly?  


3. Data cleaning and EDA (10 pts)    

    - Does it include clear explanations on how and why cleaning is performed?
      Depending on your data, some examples of EDA might include:
      - Tabulated data cleaning examples:  Inspect null values and drop or impute.  

      - User/product ratings data examples:
      Basic EDAs on user count, product count, and basic data cleaning/processing (e.g., proper data types and treating null values)

      - Text data examples:
      Basic EDA such as word count, histogram, etc., and basic data cleanings such as stop words removal, Explaining word embedding methods: When you evaluate, the score is based on how they demonstrated understanding by explaining the concepts and giving reasonings why they chose the methods/techniques, etc., but not based on just complexity of the model or technique or just performance alone.

      - Image or sound data examples:
      Pixel value count or histogram, spectral analysis such as power spectrum or frequency analysis to make feature vectors, etc


    - Does it include clear explanations on how and why a certain analysis (EDA) is performed?

    - Does it have proper visualization?

    - Does it have proper analysis? E.g., histogram, correlation matrix, heatmap, plots, etc.

    - Does it have conclusions or discussions? E.g., the EDA summary, findings, discussing foreseen difficulties and/or analysis strategy.

4. Model building / Model choice (15 pts)    
    How many models have been used and compared? Any reasonings for the model choice?

5. Model training (15 pts)    
    Show model training procedure, including hyperparameter tuning. Show any procedure for measuring train and/or test performances.

6. Results and Analysis: (20 pts)
    -  Does it have a summary of results and analysis?
    -  Does it have a proper visualization? (e.g., tables, graphs/plots, heat maps, statistics summary with interpretation, etc)
    -  Does it use different kinds of evaluation metrics properly? Also, does it explain why they chose the metric?
    -  Does it iterate the training and evaluation process and improve the performance? Does it address selecting features through the iteration process?
    -  Did the author compare the results from the multiple models and make appropriate comparisons?

7. Discussion and Conclusion: (10 pts)
  Add your discussion on the results, ways to improve the results
