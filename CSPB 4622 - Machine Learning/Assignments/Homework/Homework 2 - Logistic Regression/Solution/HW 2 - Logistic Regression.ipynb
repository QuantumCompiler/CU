    "Your first task is to complete the function `gen_logistic` in the following cell so as to be able to generate the logistic function for a given input. The logistic function is a type of <em>sigmoid</em> function which has an 'S'-shape and 'squashes' its inputs to a value lying in the range [0,1]. Other sigmoid functions include the hyperbolic-tangent funcition (`tanh(x)`) and the error function (`erf(x)`).[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function].     \n",
