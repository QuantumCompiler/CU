        \subsubsection*{Brief Description of Course Content}
    
        This course serves as an introduction to Cognitive Science, the study of the mind, as an interdisciplinary field with roots in Computer Science along with Psychology, Education, and a variety of 
        other fields. Our survey of this area centers on how these ideas of mind both inform and are influenced by computer science ideas. \vspace*{1em}
        
        \subsubsection*{Specific Outcomes of Instruction}
        
        By the end of the course, you should have developed an understanding of the human mind and be able to contribute to discussions, research, and technical work related to the course topics. Hopefully,
