        \subsubsection*{Brief Description of Course Content}
    
        Surveys artificial intelligence techniques of search, knowledge representation and reasoning, probabilistic inference, machine learning, and natural language. \vspace*{1em}
        
        \subsubsection*{Specific Outcomes of Instruction}
    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An ability to explain what AI is about, what it can solve, its brief history and applications, and its social impact.
            \item An ability to explain key concepts such as agents, environment and how the type of the agent and the environment affect the choice of an algorithm.
            \item An ability to explain how each AI algorithm works and implement those in codes.
            \item An ability to explain the algorithm properties such as completeness, optimality, time and space complexity and can compare algorithm efficiencies.
            \item Determine suitable AI algorithms to apply to a specific problem.
        \end{itemize}
